Troubleshooting
***************


Can not connect to Arduino.
Is the Arduino connected to the USB port. Check the port in your fabscanpi-server configuration
file. Try another port e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0.
More information about changing the configuration can be found in "FabScan Pi Configuration"
section.

Camera is not connected.
Check the cable from the Raspberry Pi to the camera module. Be careful the cable can be very
fragil. Try another camera application for checking camera functionality e.g. [raspistill](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/raspicam/raspistill.md).
